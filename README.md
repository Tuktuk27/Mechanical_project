# Various mechanical project, design, simulation and prototyping

## Heavy Drone Frame design 

Project Description:
This project aimed to design and develop a modular heavy drone frame, with both quadcopter and octocopter configurations, capable of carrying a 100 kg payload. The project involved 3D design, rendering, prototyping, and conducting strength analysis, natural frequency and resonant frequency evaluations, and ensuring safety factors.

Role and Responsibilities:
As a mechanical engineer, I was responsible for designing the droneâ€™s frame and shape, exploring multiple configurations, and performing strength analysis and safety factor calculations to ensure structural stability and reliability. I also handled part orders, assembly, 2D drawings, and 3D modeling. Additionally, I contributed to creating images for project presentations, and actively participated in team meetings to make design decisions and report progress.

Project Outcome:
Successfully designed and completed several configurations of the heavy drone frame, with comprehensive strength analysis and optimization ensuring safety across different conditions. Through 3D modeling and rendering, I provided visual design concepts, and the prototype was successfully built, meeting the payload and performance goals.

## Giant exponential horn

Project Description:
This project aimed to restore a giant exponential horn and historical instrument components for the Luxembourg Center for Contemporary and Digital History. The horn was designed to be 2.4 meters long, with a mouth diameter of 1.2 meters, a weight of approximately 10 kg, and capable of being disassembled for transportation and storage, while ensuring optimal sound propagation as per scientific references.

Role and Responsibilities:
In this project, I was responsible for the 3D design of the horn to meet 3D printing requirements and conducted the assembly work. I referred to a scientific paper to follow equations ensuring optimal sound propagation through the horn. I also engaged with the client, adapting the design to their specifications, and was supervised by a teacher throughout the process. For the horn and small gramophone components, I selected appropriate materials that balanced printing quality, strength, and sound handling, while adhering to the constraints of 3D printer dimensions and capabilities.

Project Outcome:
The giant horn was successfully designed and manufactured, meeting the requirements for disassembly, reassembly, and optimized acoustic performance. Suitable materials and printing parameters were chosen to ensure high-quality results. The final product exceeded expectations, serving as both a functional instrument and a striking piece for the Luxembourg Center for Contemporary and Digital History.
